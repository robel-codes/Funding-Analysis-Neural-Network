# Funding-Analysis-Neural-Network

This application contains analysis work for risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, to create a model that predicts whether applicants will become successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Analysis include

- Preprocess data for a neural network model.
- Use the model-fit-predict pattern to complile and evaluate a binary classification model and Optimize the model

## Report

#### Data Preprocessing

- Read the appplications_data.csv file into a Panda DataFrame
- Drop the "EIN" and "NAME" columns from the DataFrame
- Encoded the categorical variables of the dataset
- using the preprocessed datea , defined the datasets and split into training and testind datasets
- compiled and evaluated a binary classification models

#### Summary

- Tested two alternatives to optimize model first with added more neruons to a hidden layer and second with different activation funtions resulted in the almost similar accuracy to the original model
